% This repository presents the c3_algorithm for detecting and fitting hypobolae
% from Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) B-scan images.

% All functions are provided in the /c3_algorithms folder.
% Other functions used in the Matlab toolboxes include:
% -- Curve Fitting Toolbox: smooth()
% -- Image Processing Toolbox: edge()

% You can launch run_example.m to see how to use the provided code.
