This repository presents the c3_algorithm for detecting and fitting hypobolae from Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) B-scan images.


-- The /c3_algorithms folder contains all core functions, with c3_hyperbola_fitting() as the main interface. 

-- The run_example.m file demonstrates how to use the code, along with five testing GPR images.

-- Two Matlab toolboxes are required in the main code, including 
-- Curve Fitting Toolbox: smooth() 
-- Image Processing Toolbox: edge()

You can launch run_example.m to see how to use the provided code.
